The aim is to supply a user with a TUI that will aid them in filling in by hand, census pages from the UK and saving the resulting page as an html. 

Currently it is setup for 1861 only. 


all years from 1841-1921 need to be accounted for (as designs)

A user must be able to select the year, then the questions need to be filled in. Then it can save the appropriate details out.
