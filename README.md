The aim is to supply a user with a TUI that assists in filling in census pages from the UK by hand and saves the result as HTML.

Currently it is set up for 1861 only, but the program now starts by asking the
user which census year they wish to work with.  The list covers 1841 through
1921.  Once a year is chosen the form appears and can be filled in and saved as
HTML.
